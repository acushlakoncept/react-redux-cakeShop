# Calculator App Using React

In this project, I developed a cake shop app while learning React Redux using a follow along tutorial by [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwheJHvseC3I0HuYI2f46oAK), Some of the major concepts explored are as follows:

- Understanding React-Redux, actions, action types, reducers and store
- Multiple reducers concept using combine Reducers
- Middleware
- Using connect method vs react-redux with hooks
- Logger middleware
- Async Actions
- Redux Thunk get Request
